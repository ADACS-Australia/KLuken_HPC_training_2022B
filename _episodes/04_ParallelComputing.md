## Intro
For many people parallel computing brings to mind optimization.
Whilst optimization can often lead you down the path of parallel computing, the two are not the same.

Work with a workflow mindset.
Identify your **goals** first, then your **inputs**, then your **tools**.
A workflow maps inputs to goals using tools.

Optimize your total workflow:

Amdahl's Law: 
- System speed-up limited by the slowest component.

Paulâ€™s rule of thumb: 
- You are the slowest component.

Therefore: 
1. Focus on reducing **your** active interaction time,
2. *then* on your total wait time, 
2. *then* on cpu time.

Avoid premature optimisation:

Verify that you **have** a problem before you spend resources **fixing** a problem.

Good coding practices can lead to more performant code from the outset.
This is **not** wasted time.

You can't optimize to zero.
Working fast is good, but avoiding work is better.
Repeated computing is wasted computing.
[Check-pointing](https://hpc-unibe-ch.github.io/slurm/checkpointing.html) and [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) are good for this.

Embrace sticky tape solutions:
- Build on existing solutions
- Use your code to move between solutions (eg BASH / Python)
- Only write new code where none exists
- Choose a language/framework that suits the problem
- Optimize only when there is a problem


## Types of parallelism	
One of the biggest advantages of using an HPC is that you will have access to a large number of processing cores.
These cores are often not that much faster than what you have on a desktop machine (they may even have a lower clock speed).
A desktop machine will probably have between 4-12 CPU cores, where as the individual nodes of an HPC facility will have 24-48 cores, and of course there can be hundreds or thousands of such nodes within the facility.
The key to making best use of HPC resources is thus organizing your work to make the best use of these multiple cores, and this means that you need to understand how to work in parallel.

There are many different levels of parallelism that you can work with, which we'll explore now.

### Task based parallelism
In task based parallelism we are working at the highest level of abstraction.
In this model we take our workflow and break it into discrete tasks and then ask which tasks are independent of each other.
These independent tasks can then be run at the same time in parallel.
You may see these tasks referred to as *embarrassingly parallel* tasks.

Depending on how the software is implemented there are two main ways to run tasks in parallel:
1. Run one task per compute node, with many nodes being use at once. This would typically mean running an array job.
2. Run one task per CPU within a single compute node, with just one node being used at a time. This would be facilitated with a single job script.

We can of course run hybrid models which combine the two above extremes.
Suppose we have 1000 tasks that need to be done, and each task can be completed using a single CPU core in 6hours.
Suppose we want to run this on [OzStar](https://supercomputing.swin.edu.au/ozstar/), such that we have 107 compute nodes, each with 36 CPU cores ([of which we can use 32](https://supercomputing.swin.edu.au/docs/2-ozstar/oz-slurm-create.html)).
We could use (1) above, but it would required 1,000 nodes x 6 hours of resources (6,000 node hours), and only use 1/36th of the available cores available on each node.
This is not a good use of resources.
We can't use (2) above because our nodes don't have 1000 cores in any single node.
Instead we could divide our 1,000 tasks into `1000/32 = ~ 32` jobs, and then within each job run one task per CPU (assuming it will fit within the memory constraints of the node).
This could be achieved by having a job array of 32 jobs, and each job would orchestrate the running of tasks numbered `(n-1)*32` to `(n-1)*32 + n`, and making sure that the last job in the array stops at the 1,000th task.
This method will result in 32 nodes x 6 hours of resources, or ~32 better than the previous option.
We refer to this type of organization as job packing.

Here is a visualization of what we are doing:
![JobPacking]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/JobPacking.png %})
In the top left we have the worst case scenario where a single user uses a node to run a task that uses just one core of the node.
In the top right is a more realistic view of what happens when node resources can be shared.
Multiple users can run jobs on the same node, but it's not common that the requests people make are going to add up to 100% resource usage so there will be some wastage.
In the bottom left is the goal that we are aiming for with job packing - complete use of all the CPU cores for the tasks we are running.

Occasionally, the limiting resource on a compute node is not the number of CPU cores but the amount of RAM available.
If we can either limit or estimate the peak RAM usage of our tasks then we can adjust our job packing such that we use as much of the RAM as possible per node.
For example, we might have 192GB of RAM available per node, but have a task that uses up to 10GB of RAM, and so we'd only be able to pack 19 copies of this task onto each of our compute nodes.

If we instead had 10,000,000 tasks that each took 20 second to run this would still have a total run time of approx 6,000 node hours, the same requirement as the previous example.
However, SLURM takes some time to schedule a job, allocate resources, and then clean up when the job completes.
This time is not that long (maybe 30 seconds), so if your job has a relatively short run time (few minutes) then this overhead becomes a significant overhead.
In such cases we can pack our jobs such that we have 10,000 jobs running within a single job, but only 32 running at one time.
This is a second form of job packing.

In each of the above implementations the parallelism is being handled by a combination of SLURM and our batch job scripts.
We don't need to have any knowledge of (or access to) the source code of the program that is actually doing the compute.

In a [previous lesson]({{page.root}}{% link _episodes/03_WorkingOnAnHPC.md %}#parallel_workflows) we explored job arrays, so we won't revisit them here, however we will dive a little deeper into job packing.

### Job packing with `xargs`

The program `xargs` is standard on most Unix based systems and was created to "build and execute command lines from standard input".
At its most basic level, `xargs` will accept input from STDIN and convert this into commands which are then executed in the shell.
`xargs` is able to manage the execution of these sub processes that it spawns and thus can be used to run multiple programs in parallel.

If we were to have a file which consisted of greetings, one per line, we could use xargs to echo each of these greetings.

cat greetings  | xargs -P 4 -exec echo {}\;

TODO: a bunch of info graphics for the above, plus an exercise for the learners.

intro `xargs` and demonstrate it's use on a local machine or interactive session

show also that `srun` can be used to manage jobs slightly more easily than xargs (though only on a SLURM system), by using `srun --exclusive`

 
### Domain or Data based parallelism
Consider an task that reads a data array, transforms it, and then writes it out again.
The simplest implementation of such a task can be represented as follows, where `f(x)` represents the transform, and we iterate over all the data in order:
![SISD]({{page.root}}{% link fig/SISD.png %})
In this example we have one compute unit doing all the work.

If multiple compute units are available then we can parallelize our work by having each compute unit perform the same set of instructions, but working on different parts of the data.
We can then have these processes running in parallel as follows, and do the same work in 1/3 the time.
![SISDx3]({{page.root}}{% link fig/SISDx3.png %})

The above approach is often referred to as either domain or data based parallelism, because we are dividing our data into domains, and then working on each domain in parallel.
Here we assume that the work that needs to be done to compute `f(x_i)` is independent of any previous results, or rather, that the order in which the results are computed is unimportant.

If our particular computing task falls into the above category, then we can replace our single processing design with a multiprocessing design in which all the processes that are doing the work have access to the same input/output memory locations.
This form of parallelism requires that all the compute processes have access to the same memory which *usually* means that they all have to be on the same node of the HPC cluster that you are working on.



Another form of parallelism occurs when we have the same input data, but we want to process this data in different ways to give different outputs.

We could simply write completely different programs to perform the different calculations, but typically there is some preprocessing or setup work that needs to be done which is common between all the tasks.
