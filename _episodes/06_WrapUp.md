## Summary
- HPC is more than just lots of desktops joined together
- Multiple users share the system and run jobs via a queue scheduler
- Plan your work and map it onto a workflow for SLURM to execute
- Use array jobs and dependencies for easier workflow management
- Find software with LMOD or Singularity / Docker hub
- Parallelism is not about optimization per se
- Understanding your workflow is key to planning your parallel processing
- Start with what is easy, make things harder only when necessary
- If using python leverage numpy data structures and functions
- HPC time is like telescope time - you need science + resource justification
- The best way of estimating resources is to run your workflow on test data

## NextFlow training
Soon (date TBC) ADACS will be running a training session focused on the [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) workflow manager.
This training will build on much of what we have learned here, with a focus on building workflows that take a lot of the pain out of scheduling and monitoring jobs and managing singularity containers.
When we have a date for this training we will ping back to this list to invite people to participate.
Until then, practice what you have learned.
