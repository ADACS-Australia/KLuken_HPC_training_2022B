## NextFlow training
Soon (date TBC) ADACS will be running a training session focused on the NextFlow workflow manager.
This training will build on much of what we have learned here, with a focus on building workflows that take a lot of the pain out of scheduling and monitoring jobs and managing singularity containers.
When we have a date for this training we will ping back to this list to invite people to participate.
Until then, practice what you have learned.

Please fill in this [feedback survey](#TODO) so that we can continue to provide training like this and improve.
