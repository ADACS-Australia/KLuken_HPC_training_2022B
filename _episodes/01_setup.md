## Overview
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) at the request of Kieran Luken as part of their 2022B training project.
This course is aimed at researchers who are new to using HPC facilities and is intended to be an overview of HPC concepts, how to run jobs, how to efficiently make use of the available resources, and to find out what HPC facilities they can access.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Software Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions, some of it will require learners to write code or use the HPC facility for themselves, and other parts will be treated as a discussion session where no or little HPC interaction will be needed.

## Required software / services
You will need:
- Access to Teams/Webex video conferencing system (depending on which works on the day!)
- A bash terminal
- Access to OzSTAR (see below)
- A zest for life

See instructions on the [home page]({{page.root}}#Setup)

### An account on OzSTAR
You will need to have a login to the OzSTAR supercomputer in order to complete some of the exercises for this course.
See [these instructions](https://supercomputing.swin.edu.au/docs/1-getting_started/Accounts.html) for how you can obtain an account.

Once you have an account you'll need to [request to join](https://supercomputing.swin.edu.au/account-management/project_join_request) the group `oz983`.

Obtaining an account can take up to 2 days, joining a project will be faster because it only requires the approval of the group admin which is [Paul Hancock](mailto:paul.hancock@curtin.edu.au).
